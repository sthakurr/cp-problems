This includes the important data structures in python, useful in solving some complex problems efficiently.

## Binary Tree
A data structure with the following properties:
- Each left subnode should have smaller value than its parent node
- Each right subnode should have greater value than its parent node
- Each left and right subtree must also be a binary search tree
